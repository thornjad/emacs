#+title: Thornjad's Emacs Configuration

Here lives my own configuration for GNU Emacs, blending all the best shit I can find, making a conscious effort for speed, robustness and above all, skillfulness. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

This is most definitely not a general distribution Emacs configuration system. It undergoes constant evolution; bindings, settings and packages change with no warning and little to no documentation. This project is open source as a reference or source of ideas. Use at your own risk.

To get started with Emacs, I highly recommend the distribution responsible for hooking me in: [[https://spacemacs.org][Spacemacs]].

My configuration is in a literate org format, and can be read in its [[./config.org][original org format]].
